    <h1>Manfredi Bernardi</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>I'm a 20 years old student who wants to change the world building global tech companies with cool people </li>
        <li>I was born in 2004 in Sicily, Italy, and throughout my life I lived in Milan, Berlin, Lisbon and Paris </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I have done till now</h2>

    <h3>Esports and Twitch</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>From 14 to 18 years old, I have played Fortnite as a professional player for top esports team (<a href="https://hmble.it/">Humble</a>, <a href="https://x.com/idominaesports">iDomina</a>, <a href="https://outplayedgaming.com//">Outplayed</a>) under the IGN of <a href="https://fortnite-esports.fandom.com/wiki/Fredy">Fredy</a>, earning over $30K in tournament prize pools </li>
        <li>During this time I also grew a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fredybtw">Twitch channel</a> to over 25k subscribers and became a Twitch partner in 2019â€”all while balancing high-school</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Work and Research</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the summer of 2024 I worked as a Founder's Associate at <a href="https://www.godiligent.ai/">Diligent</a>, a YCombinator-backed (YCW24) startup helping fintech risk and compliance teams automate and strengthen CDD with ML </li>
        <li>I am also a Stanford Research Assistant in Ilya Strebulaev's group (<a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/labs-initiatives/vci">VCI Lab</a>), and worked at Amazon as a PM Intern </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Side Hustles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To pay for my living expenses and college tuition, I've built a profitable portfolio of books (15+ books) on Amazon KDP that generates me a full-time London McKinsey consultant income ($3K net per month ish) fully passively </li>
        <li>These 3 [<a href="https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0D4M1X1F6">(i)</a>; <a href="https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0CZF5698Q">(ii)</a>; <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0DC4F6N25">(iii)</a>] are the books that sells the most. To market them, I've built for each a Tiktok page (i.e <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@libro.degli.innamorati">(ii)</a>) where I publish viral content </li>
        <li>I finally hired a virtual assistant to handle the day-to-day tasks, allowing me to generate a full salary without dedicating even an hour per week to the business</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What I'm looking for now</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I am looking for a job as a Generalist (FA/CoS)/Growth/Product (i can code) in cool technology companies
    </ul>
